GECCO 2016 NodIO-based presentations.

It uses Cal Evans `external` plugin for modularization, but will
contain all presentations. Since this plugin needs a server for XHR,
you will need to have a server running to check it out locally. You
can install http-server via

	npm install http-server

and run it

	http-server

inside the dir.
